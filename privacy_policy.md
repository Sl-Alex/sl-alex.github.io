This policy informs you about data being collected during browsing and explains why and how your private data is stored and processed.

## Information we collect and process
**We collect nothing. Period.** No, really. We don't care about any personal data you may own. Your gender, skin tone, age, location, bank account or any other personal information you can ever think about belongs solely to you, we don't want and will not ask you to provide it to us. This approach gives us freedom and full compliance with all local regulations regarding personal data collection and processing. This is the reason why you don't see this annoying GDPR banner anywhere on this website.
